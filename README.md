# adguard-lists
Personal lists for adguard, in adguard format.
Will probably work in other DNS based blocking software with some formatting.

This comes from various sources, that I collected through years scrolling trhough reddit, forums, discourses and other communities, so its nigh impossible to put all the authors here.

Also contains domains that I collected from my own experience.
I'm certain that except form some very specific cases, most of these will already be included in the major blacklists out there, but I keep them just in case.
